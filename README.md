## IMPORTANT

 Here are something you should know before using this extension in a project.

 1. The technical limitations of custom extension

    > Due to technical limitations of the sandbox, every call to a custom extension will stop the current script for a full frame, regardless of turbo mode or run without screen refresh.

    (extracted from [TurboWarp Documentation](https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/custom-extensions))

    This means every custom extension block will act like an empty "wait () seconds" block but do not affected by turbo mode or custom block (run without screen refresh).

 2. The stability of this extension

    Due to any possible bugs and various uncertainties, I can not promise there will not have any breaking changes affecting the projects, so I created a "version" folder in this repository to store every version of the extension.

    Use the file in the "version" folder for a project instead:  
    `https://bill96012.github.io/scratch-operator-extension/version/(version).js`
